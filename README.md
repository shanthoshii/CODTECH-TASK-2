# 📊 Predictive Analysis Using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a regression-based machine learning model to predict medical insurance charges using personal and demographic information. It covers the full cycle of predictive analytics: from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and insights.

## 📁 About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `insurance.csv`. It contains the following features:

- **age**: Age of the individual  
- **sex**: Gender (`male` or `female`)  
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index  
- **children**: Number of children covered by health insurance  
- **smoker**: Whether the person smokes  
- **region**: Residential area (`northeast`, `southeast`, `northwest`, `southwest`)  
- **charges**: Medical insurance charges (target variable)

This dataset is commonly used for regression problems and demonstrates the impact of factors like smoking and BMI on insurance costs.

## 📌 Key Data Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading** – Loaded the CSV file using `pandas`.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Reviewed dataset shape, types, missing values, and distributions.
3. **Data Preprocessing** – 
   - Encoded categorical variables (`sex`, `smoker`, `region`) using one-hot encoding.
   - Handled duplicates or null values if any.
4. **Feature Selection** – Selected input features and target (`charges`).
5. **Train-Test Split** – Divided the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`.
6. **Model Building** – Applied **Linear Regression** to learn from the data.
7. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluated model performance using:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R-squared (R²)
8. **Visualization** – Created scatter plots to compare actual vs predicted charges.

## 🔎 Insights and Findings

- **Smokers** pay significantly higher insurance charges than non-smokers.
- **Age** and **BMI** are positively correlated with insurance costs.
- The linear regression model provides a moderate to strong fit with an R² score, indicating good predictive capability on test data.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Use more advanced models like **Random Forest Regressor**, **XGBoost**, or **Support Vector Regression**.
- Perform **feature scaling** and **polynomial regression** to capture non-linear relationships.
- Implement **cross-validation** for more robust model performance.
- Deploy the trained model using **Streamlit** or **Flask** to create a web application.
- Introduce **hyperparameter tuning** for optimization.
